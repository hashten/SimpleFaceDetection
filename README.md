# SimpleFaceDetection2
Using Boosting (AdaBoost) with haar-features (Viola and Jones [2001])

This facedetector was done as part of a course at KTH called Image Based Recognition and Classification (DD2427). 

The code is for the most parts poorly commented but that will be fixed later in june 2015.
